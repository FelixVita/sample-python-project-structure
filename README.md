## Docs

I recommend using Sphinx.
To get started, navigate to the `docs` directory and run `sphinx-quickstart`.
This will create the necessary files and directory structure.

You will be faced with the choice of separating the source and build directories.
If you do so, you'll place your markdown and/or reStructuredText files in the source directory.
The build directory will contain the generated HTML files.
