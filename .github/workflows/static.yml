# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
# Primarily based on the default starter workflow (from GitHub Settings > Pages),
# and with some content (the docs build steps) adapted from EEHolmes-DataScience's YouTube tutorial [GitHub Action: Sphinx documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxkM1SK9YlI)

name: Deploy static html docs to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
